**Daily Agenda (1 hour)**

- 10 minutes: Review and revise the concepts learned in the previous session.
- 40 minutes: Learn new topics, algorithms, or data structures.
- 10 minutes: Practice with coding exercises or small programming challenges.

**Tips:**

- Collaborate and discuss with your peers regularly to reinforce learning.
- Utilize online platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces for practice.
- Try solving problems independently first, and then discuss and compare solutions with your peers.
- Encourage each other and celebrate progress during the 30-day learning journey.
